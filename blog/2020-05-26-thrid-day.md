Basicly getting a pretrained model to learn new things.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRpZ5OqUY6Y&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y&index=5) that I followed.

Theres a site called[Teachable
Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) which is made by a bunch of
people at google. Allow you to training their existing model with images of your
own. I trained on two images.

Class 1 - 332 samples

Class 2 - 272 samples

I exported the model, set up a node server [here](https://github.com/ShahNafis/tensorflowjs/tree/master/_src/tutorial/Transfer_Learning/exported_model) to run the p5.js code that the
website exports and the following where the results.
