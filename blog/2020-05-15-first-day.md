First day trying to use TensorFlow.js and finding out what I need to learn

<!--truncate-->

At the page [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials), the TensorFlow.js
site mentions a high level path where I do not have to worry aobut Tensors and
Optimizers and a low level path. Since I have no idea what Tensors/Optimizers
are I choose to go the high level path and use `ml5.js`

So heading over to the [ml5.js](https://learn.ml5js.org/docs/#/) site they
suggest watching Dan Shiffmans videos on introduction to ml5.js which after
looking around a big on his playlists lead to
[this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y).
*Turns out YouTube has all our answers.*

So theres quite of few libraries/packages that are going to be used 

- `TensorFlow` - Which is made by Google and usualy used in Python which is
basicly running C++.
- `TensorFlow.js` is also made by Google and does everything in JavaScript.
- `ml5.js` is written on top of `TensorFlow.js`. `TensorFlow.js` is a low level
  lib where as `ml5.js` abstracts that out a bit so you dont have to worry about
  stuff like memory management(like points in C++ vs Java).
- `P5.js` - A weird library ment for the creative people to make coding easier.
  It has some drawing functions and some calculation functions. It basically
  treats the entire webpage as a drawing pad.

So that will be it for now, I still need to figure out how I am going to
structure the repo and the doc site!
