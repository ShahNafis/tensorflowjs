### Welcome

This project came as a suggestion from one of my professors, Dr.Mohanty, about
how since I know alot about JavaScript I should take a look into `TensorFlow.js`
which would be another useful thing to know but also sought after as its
relativly new.

This doc site will host blog post section to show my daily progress and a
documentation section to have a more structure examples and explanation of what
I learned as well as my own attemps other then just following a tutorial.
